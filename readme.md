I've set cat as the object, name as its key and age as its value.

    Cat Object Schema:

    name: String (required)
    age: Number (required)
    timestamp: Number (not required)
    
  ------
  
    Using the API:
    
    POST requests   
    - /cats
    
    GET requests    
    - /cats     *to get all cats in mongoDB, for easier testing*
    - /cats/(name)  
    - /cats/(name)?timestamp=(timestamp value)

  ------



Original instructions:
==========================================================================================

Build a version controlled key-value store with a HTTP API we can query that from. The API needs to be able to:

1. Accept a key(string) and value(some json blob/string) {"key" : "value"} and store them. If an existing key is sent, the value should be updated

2. Accept a key and return the corresponding latest value

3. When given a key AND a timestamp, return whatever the value of the key at the time was.

Assume only GET and POST requests for simplicity.

Example:

Method: POST

Endpoint: /object

Body: JSON: {mykey : value1}

Time: 6.00 pm

Response: {"key":"mykey", "value":"value1", "timestamp": time } //Where time is timestamp of the post request (6.00pm) .

------

Method: GET 

Endpoint: /object/mykey

Response: {"value": value1 } 

------

Method: POST

Endpoint: /object

Body: JSON: {mykey : value2}

Time: 6.05 pm

Response: {"key":"mykey", "value":"value2", "timestamp": time } //Where time is timestamp of the new value (6.05pm) .


------

Method: GET 

Endpoint: /object/mykey

Response: {"value": value2 }

------

Method: GET 

Endpoint: /object/mykey?timestamp=1440568980 [6.03pm] // notice that the time here is not exactly 6.00pm

Response: {"value": value1 } // still return value 1 , because value 2 was only added at 6.05pm



All timestamps are unix timestamps according UTC timezone.

Guidelines:

1. Use NodeJS for scripting the backend. 

2. Deploy this to a server and give us the URL

3. Push the code to a public git repository and give us the URL.

4. You are free to use any open source database.

A good submission will have the following characteristics:

1. Clean and extendable code

2. Handle a wide variety of edge cases

3. Not break under a reasonable load

4. Show knowledge of the various testing methodology

We are NOT judging for algorithmic brilliance or cool one liners. We want to see if you can write production quality code. So please build this assuming you are building a production quality service.
