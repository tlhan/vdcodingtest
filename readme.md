Vault Dragon Coding Test:

Note: I've set cats as the object, key as its name and value as its age.




CODING INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================================================================================

Build a version controlled key-value store with a HTTP API we can query that from. The API needs to be able to:

Accept a key(string) and value(some json blob/string) {"key" : "value"} and store them. If an existing key is sent, the value should be updated

Accept a key and return the corresponding latest value

When given a key AND a timestamp, return whatever the value of the key at the time was.

Assume only GET and POST requests for simplicity.

Example:

Method: POST

Endpoint: /object

Body: JSON: {mykey : value1}

Time: 6.00 pm

Response: {"key":"mykey", "value":"value1", "timestamp": time } //Where time is timestamp of the post request (6.00pm) .

Method: GET

Endpoint: /object/mykey

Response: {"value": value1 }

Method: POST

Endpoint: /object

Body: JSON: {mykey : value2}

Time: 6.05 pm

Response: {"key":"mykey", "value":"value2", "timestamp": time } //Where time is timestamp of the new value (6.05pm) .

Method: GET

Endpoint: /object/mykey

Response: {"value": value2 }

Method: GET

Endpoint: /object/mykey?timestamp=1440568980 [6.03pm] // notice that the time here is not exactly 6.00pm

Response: {"value": value1 } // still return value 1 , because value 2 was only added at 6.05pm

All timestamps are unix timestamps according UTC timezone.

Guidelines:

Use NodeJS for scripting the backend.

Deploy this to a server and give us the URL

Push the code to a public git repository and give us the URL.

You are free to use any open source database.

A good submission will have the following characteristics:

Clean and extendable code

Handle a wide variety of edge cases

Not break under a reasonable load

Show knowledge of the various testing methodology

We are NOT judging for algorithmic brilliance or cool one liners. We want to see if you can write production quality code. So please build this assuming you are building a production quality service.
